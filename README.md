Tools to work with results from variance components estimation

## Background
One of the first steps in the development of a new genetic analysis routine for a new trait is the estimation of 
variance components. This is done using specialised software programs. Most of these programs do not provide any 
functionality to compare the results of different estimation runs or to display the results graphically. These 
post-processing tasks are the main goal of this package.
